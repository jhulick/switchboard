Fire Hydrant / Switchboard is a toolkit for assembling XMPP clients.

It comes with some example instances that handle roster and pubsub subscription management.  (They should take command-line arguments but don't yet; fix your fire_hydrant.yml with appropriate settings).

It also comes with a sample consumer for Fire Eagle's preliminary XMPP pubsub node.  It does *not* appear to work with Google Talk accounts, but Jabber.org accounts seem fine.

For Fire Eagle subscriptions to work properly, you'll have to obtain a valid OAuth access token and put it in fire_hydrant.yml.  You'll need a General Purpose access token (issued to apps that register using 'web' auth) in order to list subscriptions.  Before running the consumer, you should add 'fireeagle.com' to your roster.

There's also the chance that our pubsub node has gone offline, which won't help you with debugging ;-)  I did mention that all of this is pre-alpha preliminary, etc?

Please please please let me know how this works for you.
